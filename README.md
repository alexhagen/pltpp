# pltpp
pltpp is a staging ground for additional matplotlib functionality.  It will hold experimental or seldom used functionality, and, if something gets popular, we will stage it and try to get it approved in matplotlib proper.  it's intended to be used as a drop in replacement for matplotlib (or I guess, more correctly, pyplot), by

```python
import pltpp as plt

plt.plot(...)
```
